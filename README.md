# Bulk DALL-E

Easy Python script that allows user to input a prompt text file and generate 1 image per prompt within the text file using OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model.
Each prompt per line in the prompt text file.
You will be able to enter your own expanded context to augment each prompt.
You *will* need your own OpenAI API key to run this script.
